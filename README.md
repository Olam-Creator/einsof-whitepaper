# Einsof - Living AI Governance System

> An autonomous AI orchestration framework that governs itself through coherence metrics and quality gates.

## What is Einsof?

Einsof is an experimental AI system designed as a living organism rather than a static tool. It features:

- **Self-governance**: Quality gates (SLO) and coherence metrics (Rho) guide autonomous decisions
- **Modular architecture**: Independent "angels" (specialized agents) handle different domains
- **Living documentation**: This whitepaper updates automatically as the system evolves

## What is Guardian Angel?

Guardian Angel is Einsof's user-facing product - a personal AI assistant that:

- Manages your projects, finances, and daily tasks
- Learns from your patterns without compromising privacy
- Operates transparently with explainable decisions
